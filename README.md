Before you continue
===================

This is a small side-project that was born out of the interest in
the design process of the Elm language. It is not an officially 
published project and doing so would very likely be against Elm's
creator Evan Czaplicki's wishes - see 
[this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/71bp2o/comment/dn9rygg).
So please be kind and refrain from putting this tool into
circulation!
